              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I am Cariel A. Pocong a SHS student of Badian NHS. I am already 18 years old. I was born on January 23, 2005 at Bantayan II, Basdiot, 
                Moalboal, Cebu. I am an aquarians. I am an approachable type of person. Sometimes I easily get mad for no reason. Another thing is I don't have plan in life, I just go with the flow.

Kyle is my next then followed by Kristyl and to our youngest one Krislie. All of them called me "Kuya". The funniest part is I was the one who's name starts with letter C.<br>

                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love reading or watching fantasy and scifi books/movies. My favorite sport is Volleyball even though I am not good at playing it. Also, I love eating lechon baboy especially its crispy skin that taste so good and delicious. The colors that will attract my attentions are grey, black, and peach. Lastly, I like people who are friendly and bubbly, cute and smiley, and very simple.<br>

            <h1>My Challenges</h1>
            <h2>“Being challenged in life is inevitable, being defeated is optional.”</h2>
            <p>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of now, I've encountered many obstacles in life and it is very hard for me to face it. It comes to the point that I want to surrender, I can't hold it anymore. But, I am very thankful to my family who are always there to lift me up and gives me courage to overcome it.<br>
            </p>
            <h1>My Dreams and Aspirations</h1>

            <p>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For dreams, I haven't decided yet. As I grow up, looking my family situation I can said to myself that they don't deserve it. They are the reason why I have the courage and guts to become a succesful one someday. I want to give thema better life, no difficulties anymore. I don't want them to suffer.<br>  
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My aspiration in life was my family. They are the reason why I didn't give up. They are my home and strength. I can't even live without them.
