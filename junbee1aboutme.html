            <p>I am interested to play ML because the characters are a lot of fun to play. They look great and have a lot of personality in aesthetics as well as actually hero abilities. There is a quickly expanding roster of heroes that for all types of heroes: tank, fighter, assassin, mage, marksman and support. The game looks great and never feels cluttered in matches. The menu systems and somewhat excessive amount of currencies can become cumbersome, but with a friend or a quick guide, it is easy to figure out what to do.</p>

            Who said that life was easy? Sometimes, almost all times life pushes us to the limit and presents itself with many challenges. But what do we do when we are faced with a new challenge? Some people might take challenges as if they were just burdens in life and behave negatively about them, and being negative about them while others might consider them as if they were the way of pushing themselves to the limit. They might seek to transcend themselves and become better persons.
